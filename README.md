This project is a Work in progress!
It is not yet ready for public use.
I will update this readme when everything important is in place.

## Goal of the project

Most sites provide an RSS/Atom feed for updates, but there exceptions.
If the site's TOS allows for (limited) crawling, this web app can generate
a feed for them.

## Private use only

For the moment, I don't plan on making the public interface of the crawler public -
I don't want to deal with user management, nor breaking the TOS of the crawled sites.

If you want to use the crawler, you have to host it yourself.

## Requirements, intallation, docs etc.

TBD
